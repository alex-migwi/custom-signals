## This gives you a very basic implementation of signals with get, set, and effect functionality.

1. ```SimpleSignal``` Function:

* Returns a callable function ```(signal)``` that holds the current value.

* The ```signal``` function is enhanced with additional properties: set and effect.

2. ```signal():```

* Acts as a getter for the signal value.

* When invoked, it simply returns the current value.

3. ```signal.set(newValue):```

* Updates the signal's value and notifies all registered listeners.

4. ```signal.effect(listener):```

* Registers a listener that gets called whenever the signal value changes.

## Lets break it down
```
const signal = (() => value) as (() => T) & {
  set: (newValue: T) => void;
  effect: (listener: () => void) => void;
};
```
1. ```() => value```

* Defines an arrow function that returns the variable ```value```.

* This means that calling ```signal()``` will return the current value of ```value```.

#### Example
```
let value = 10;
const signal = () => value;

console.log(signal()); // 10
```
2. Type Assertion Using ```as```
* The ```as``` keyword is used for type assertion, meaning we tell TypeScript to treat ```signal``` as having additional properties.

```
as (() => T) & {
  set: (newValue: T) => void;
  effect: (listener: () => void) => void;
}
```
This means:
* ```signal``` is a function that returns ```T``` when called.

* Additionally, signal is an object with two methods:

    * ```set(newValue: T)```: Updates the value.

    * ```effect(listener: () => void)```: Registers a listener that runs whenever set is called.

### Creating a Callable Object
By using type intersection ```&``` we combine a function ```() => T)``` with an object ```{ set, effect }```. The result is a function that also has properties.

This is what makes signal both:

* Callable: You can use ```signal()``` to get the value.

* Configurable: You can use ```signal.set(newValue)``` and ```signal.effect(listener)```.

### Key Takeaways
1. ```(() => value)```: Creates a function that returns value when called.

2. Type Assertion (```as```): Extends the function to also have set and effect methods.

3. Intersection Type (```&```): Combines function behavior with object properties, making ```signal``` callable and configurable.

This pattern makes ```signal``` **look like a function but behave like a reactive variable**, similar to **Angular Signals!** ðŸš€

## Run the code
To run the code samples:
1. Make sure you have typescript compiler:
```npm install -g typescript```
  * You can test your install by checking the version or help.
```
tsc --version
tsc --help
```
2. In your terminal, type for example ```tsc UpdatedComputedSimpleSignalUsage.ts```.
  * You should now see a transpiled file ```UpdatedComputedSimpleSignalUsage.js```, a javascript file.

3. Run it using ```Node.js``` by typing ```node UpdatedComputedSimpleSignalUsage.js```

Example output:
```
Double count: 4
Double count: 8
```
